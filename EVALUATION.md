# Evaluation report of Group 6

Try out the online prototype. From the presentation video, get more information on the target group etc.

Use the Cognitive Walkthrough method to walk yourself through the visualization from the perspective of a person from the target group using this visualization. Write a short story about how a person from the target group uses the visualization and what question he/she can answer with it. Does the person run into problems (e.g., reading the visualizations, using the interface etc.)?

As formal validation, address the threats mentioned in the Munzner nested model for the first three categories (domain, data/task, and visual encoding / interaction).

What possible improvements do you suggest as a result of the validation?
